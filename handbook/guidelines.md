# Templeton STEM PBL Guidelines

## If authentic learning is student initiated, then motivation should be sought at a premium.   
  1. [Projects should reflect authentic issues that are motivating for students and teachers.](authentic-issues.md)
  2. [Students need feedback that addresses goals, progress, and next steps.](feedback.md)
  3. [Projects need to be thoughtfully designed, and skillfully facilitated by the instructor.](project-design.md)
## If student learning is embodied and takes time, then we should limit the number of topics and explore them in a deep, active, and connected way.
  4. [Projects should make learning visible through the use and construction of models and artifacts.](visible-learning.md)
  5. [Projects should focus on a limited number of core concepts and include at least two iterations.](iterations.md)
  6. [Student reflection on learning should be a valued part of every project.](student-reflection.md)
## If learning is a social activity, then we should give time and value to student consensus building, presentation, and connection with the external community of practice.  
  7. [Projects should leverage group work.](group-work.md)
  8. [Discussions and presentations should be valued components of the project cycle.](disussions-and-presentations.md)
  9. [Students should network and learn from the STEM community of practice.](stem-communities.md)
